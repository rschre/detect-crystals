1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/detect_crystals.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd detect_crystals`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
3. Follow the instructions on the console to input the image path and analyze the crystals.
